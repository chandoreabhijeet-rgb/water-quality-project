Water Quality Analysis â€“ Week 2

Week 2 Summary

This week, the focus was on data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation for predicting water quality parameters.


---

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

Source: Same as Week 1

Features: Chemical and physical parameters of water samples (pH, hardness, solids, chloramines, etc.)

Target Variable: Water quality classification (Safe/Unsafe)



---

ðŸ”¹ Preprocessing Steps

Handled missing values and outliers

Standardized numeric features using StandardScaler

Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets


from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Standardize features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_scaled, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)


---

ðŸ”¹ Model Training

Models trained:

Logistic Regression (baseline)

Option to add Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.


Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall


from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report

# Train model
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate model
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))


---

ðŸ”¹ Key Steps

1. Loaded dataset using Pandas


2. Cleaned and preprocessed data


3. Scaled numeric features


4. Split data: train_test_split


5. Trained ML models


6. Evaluated model performance


7. Saved trained models for future predictions




---

ðŸ”¹ Outcomes

Preprocessing significantly improved model performance

Logistic Regression achieved a good baseline accuracy

Models are ready for further tuning and implementation of advanced algorithms in upcoming weeks



---

âœ… Next Steps (Week 3):

Experiment with advanced models like Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks

Feature importance analysis

Visualize predictions and model performance using graphs
